#Java Function Tester

This project is the result of a class assignment.
Java Function tester was an application created for a High School teacher (by college students) to help with grading several java classes at once.

##Description
Java Function Tester reads the output of the functions and compares it against the expected output.  If the output is equal to the expected output, that function gets a 'pass.' Otherwise, that function fails and can be reviewed manually.
